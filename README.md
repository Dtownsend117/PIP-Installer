This is the Python PIP Package tool
This tool will display PIPs, install, and upgrade what you have installed without the need to manually type commands for each one
The module will loop after each command in order to get use out of all methods, the exit option is also avaiable
I was going to include an internet speed test in the code as another option to inform the user of the approx time to completion but I figured it would either be innacurate 

The only thing to know about using this is that you must wait for "listening" to appear, otherwise the module will not understand your command
